TO-DO:

[] 2. Finish the UI
    [✓] 1. Add a loader
    [✓] 2. Decide the information that needs to be shown and design the UI accordingly
        [] 1. Add more stats

        [] 2. Solve Problem 4
    [✓] 3. Display differences between posts from different websites, and other common data available
    [] 4. Display messages
        [✓] 1. Add Snackbar(from Wiscro)
        [] 2. Error messages
            [✓] 1. No text input
            [] 2. No results found
        [✓] 3. Success messages: none    
        *Keep looking for more messages
    [✓] 5. Fix the height of the search container
[] 3. Write functions on server side to fetch data from websites
    * Use promises
    [✓] 1. Write API calls for Instagram
        [] 1. Add video player (Extra #1)
    [] 2. Find endpoints for other websites and write API calls
    [] 3. Turn the functions into modules and place them in /modules folder
    [✓] 4. Solve Problem #3
[] 4. Call the functions from the modules to finish the /feed endpoint 


Extra: 
[] 1. Add video player.
     Instagram CDN for videos: 
        Example URL: https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/vp/*video_name.mp4*?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com
        Look for URL in p/shortcode/?__a=1
[] 2. Add Pagination.
    Filter data with pages

Problems:
[✓] 1. Follower count problem
[✓] 2. Search bar problem on certain devices and browsers
[✓] 3. Stop using async/await for every funtion call in /feed endpoint - Load time increases because of this
    *Call async functions in parallel to solve this problem (Promise.all)
[] 4. CSS code for stats and stat container is messy, inflexible. Only deals with 3 stats from one website(Instagram)
    *Use JS along with CSS to fix this issue
[✓] 5. Fix this error: 'UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read property 'hashtag' of undefined'
