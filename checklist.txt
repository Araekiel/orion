    [✓] 2. Decide the information that needs to be shown and design the UI accordingly
        [] 1. Add more stats

        [✓] 3. Success messages: none    
        *Keep looking for more messages
    [✓] 5. Fix the height of the search container
[] 3. Write functions on server side to fetch data from websites
    * Use promises
    [✓] 1. Write API calls for Instagram
        [] 1. Add video player (Extra #1)
    [] 2. Find endpoints for other websites and write API calls
    [] 3. Turn the functions into modules and place them in /modules folder

[] 7. Use proxies while scraping data from websites

Extra:

     Instagram CDN for videos: 
        Example URL: https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/vp/*video_name.mp4*?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com
        Look for URL in p/shortcode/?__a=1
    *Video player could not be added, still working on it - Made a new stat - media type as an alternative
[] 2. Add Pagination.
    Filter data with pages
[] 3. Use fetchFollowerCount() in fetchInstagramData.js to get follower count with the help of proxies

Problems:
[✓] 1. Follower count problem

[✓] 3. Stop using async/await for every funtion call in /feed endpoint - Load time increases because of this
    *Call async functions in parallel to solve this problem (Promise.all)
[] 4. CSS code for stats and stat container is messy, inflexible. Only deals with 3 stats from one website(Instagram)
    *Use JS along with CSS to fix this issue
    *Almost done fixing this issue
[✓] 5. Fix this error: 'UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read property 'hashtag' of undefined'
[] 6. Username, Fullname and Caption don't get displayed in the right font size sometimes
